 My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you as a citizen for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you're young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your President. The same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe not in my ability to bring about change but in yours. I'm asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents. That idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists, that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice. That creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon. A creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written. Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes we can. Thank you. God bless you. May God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you.
